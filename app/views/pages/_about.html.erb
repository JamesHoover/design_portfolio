          <h3>Hello, I'm James</h3>
          <p>I have been a software developer in Seattle for three years while building websites part-time. Now I build websites full-time! My favorite part of the building process is designing the look and feel of the site. I stress a positive user experience achieved with an interesting interface and great usability. You'll find that most of my work is a healthy blend of these things.</p>
