			<span class="project-subtitle">The Problem</span>
			<p><span class="strong-text">Less than 20% of young adults (age 18-29) voted in the last US election. The overall voting turnout for the United States has been below 60% for the past 50 years. (Wikipedia)</span></p>
			<span class="project-subtitle">Research Insights</span>
			<li>Users feel the process is too complicated, complex, and time consuming for impact that their vote carries.</li>
			<li>Users are not and do not feel well informed on current issues and candidates.</li>
			<li>Users do know keep track of important dates leading up to and regarding elections and voting days</li>
			<li>Insufficient knowledge of all offices and issues that would be on the ballot prior to voting</li>
			<span class="project-subtitle">High Level Objectives</span>
			<li>Allow the user to vote for the candidate of their choice.</li>
			<li>Allow for the user to become well informed on the current issues and candidates.</li>
			<li>Allow the user to view important dates regarding elections.</li>
			<span class="project-subtitle">The Result</span>
			<p>Increased the percentage of voter participation by 20%. Reduced friction of voting. Made for a more pleasant voter experience.</p>

			<span class="project-subtitle">Personas</span>
			<p><span class="strong-text">Fred is a 25 year old developer.</span> He is active on social media. He follows elections superficially but does not care to vote because the time commitment does not outweigh his vote's impact.</p>
			<p><span class="strong-text">Tim is an 18 year old student.</span> He has never voted and has little idea what to expect. The only issue on the ballot he is aware of is voting for the president. He gets most of his information from his parents and social media. He wants to do his civil duty but does not feel like hes making his own choice, just the choice of his parents and popular opinion.</p>
			<p><span class="strong-text">Sam is a 21 year old stylist.</span> She has voted once in a presidential election. She does not like to follow politics because it is overwhelming and stresses her out.</p>
			<p><span class="strong-text">Jay is a 29 year old sales rep.</span> He stays relatively informed. He will not vote just to vote. He only dedicates the time to vote when its something he truly believes in.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="one-half">
			<span class="project-subtitle">Research</span>
			<p>Through user interview I developed the insight that when voting in person users feel pressured to complete their ballot and move on. I also got insight into how influenced users can be by their family or biased social media. Many userd have trouble dicerning facts finding unbiased sources.</p>
