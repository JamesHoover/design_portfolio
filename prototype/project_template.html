			<h2>The Problem</h2>
			<p><span class="strong-text">The voting turnout for the younger generation is way too low.</span> They lose interest and believe their vote does not make a difference or the process is too time-consuming or complex. They are not informed enough to want to make a decision or even know how. Voting is a relatively confusing/involved process which is not taught in schools. Knowing when you can vote and on what the issues are and staying informed on those issues is time consuming.</p>
			<h2>The Solution</h2>
			<p>Create a resource that makes research easier and all in one place. Allow the user to fill out a ballot and cast that ballot all from their own device in their own home.</p>
			<h2>The Result</h2>
			<p>Increased the percentage of voter participation by 20%. Reduced friction of voting. Made for a more pleasant voter experience.</p>

			<h4>Research</h4>
			<p>Through user interview I developed the insight that when voting in person users feel pressured to complete their ballot and move on. I also got insight into how influenced users can be by their family or biased social media. Many userd have trouble dicerning facts finding unbiased sources.</p>
